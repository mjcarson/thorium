/* TODO_UTOIPA: the '/files/download_result_file/:sha256/:tool/:result_id/\*path'
   route is implemented with a wildcard on the path variable, but
   Utoipa (and maybe OpenAPI?) does not handle this format. If the
   utoipa annotation for this functions is left in, the code will not
   compile because rust marks that function as "unreachable".

   One potential fix for this is to convert all the wildcards currently
   handled as Vec<String> into a single String argument that can be
   split on '/' later.

   The affected function is marked with 'TODO_UTOIPA: WIDLCARD'
   and the utoipa annotation is commented out. The annotation
   should be at least somewhat functional if it were able to be used
   but has not been tested due to the afforementioned compilation
   issue.
