# Registering For A New Thorium Account

Before you can login to Thorium you need to register for an account. This can be done through the Web UI by clicking
the register button on the login page. Then enter your username and password. If your Thorium instance is using LDAP
then use your LDAP password, otherwise you may create your new password here.
