# Thorctl
---
Thorctl is a command line tool aimed at enabling large scale operations within Thorium. Thorctl provides a variety
of features including:

- uploading files
- uploading Git repositories
- ingesting Git repositories by URL
- downloading files/repos
- starting reactions/jobs
- starting Git repo builds
- downloading results
- listing files

An example of some of these can be found in the [Users](./../users/users.md)
section of these docs.

To install Thorctl, follow the instructions for your specific operating system in the sections below.

### Linux/Mac

On a Linux or Mac machine, open a terminal window and run the following command:

<script>
  let base = window.location.origin;
  document.write("<pre>");
  document.write("<code class=\"language-bash  hljs\">");
  document.write("curl " + base + "/api/binaries/install-thorctl.sh | bash -s -- " + base);
  document.write("</code>");
  document.write("</pre>");
</script>

  #### Insecure Download

  - Although not recommended, you can bypass certificate validation and download Thorctl insecurely
    by adding the `-k` (insecure) flag to `curl` and `--insecure` at the very end of the command
    (see the command below for reference). The former tells `curl` to download the script itself
    insecurely while the latter will informs the script to use insecure communication when downloading
    Thorctl.

<script>
  document.write("<pre>");
  document.write("<code class=\"language-bash  hljs\">");
  document.write("curl -k " + base + "/api/binaries/install-thorctl.sh | bash -s -- " + base + " --insecure");
  document.write("</code>");
  document.write("</pre>");
</script>

### Windows

Download Thorctl from the following link: [Windows Thorctl](../../../binaries/windows/x86-64/thorctl.exe)


### Login Via Thorctl

After you have downloaded Thorctl, you can authenticate by running:

<script>
  document.write("<pre>");
  document.write("<code class=\"language-bash  hljs\">");
  document.write("thorctl login " + base);
  document.write("</code>");
  document.write("</pre>");
</script>

### Configure Thorctl

Logging into Thorium using `thorctl login` will generate a Thorctl config file containing the
user's authentication key and the API to authenticate to. By default, the config is stored
in `<USER-HOME-DIR>/.thorium/config.yml`, but you can manually specify a path like so:

```
thorctl --config <PATH-TO-CONFIG-FILE> ...
```

The config file can also contain various other optional Thorctl settings. To easily modify the config
file, use `thorctl config`. For example, you can disable the automatic check for Thorctl updates
by running:

```
thorctl config --skip-updates=true
```

You can specify a config file to modify using the `--config` flag as described above:

```
thorctl --config <PATH-TO-CONFIG-FILE> config --skip-updates=true
```

### Thorctl Help

Thorctl will print help info if you pass in either the `-h` or `--help` flags.

```bash
$ thorctl -h
