# Creating/Editing Groups

All resources within Thorium including files, analysis pipelines, and tools are owned by a user and uploaded to a
group. Access to modify group resources is granted by your role within the group. If you want to learn more about
Thorium's roles and permissions system, you can read [this](./adding_editing_groups.md) page. The ability to manage
group membership and create new groups is only available in Thorium's Web UI.

You may have noticed that you can add users to different group roles. As we described in the previous chapter, group roles
are how you define the abilities a group member has within the group. Roles and their abilities are defined in the table
below. Group resources can include images, pipelines, repos, files, tags, comments, and tool results.

| Ability | Owners | Managers | Users | Monitors |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| View Resources | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Run Pipelines | yes | yes | yes | no |
| Upload/Create Resources | yes | yes | yes| no |
| Modify/Delete Resources | all | all | self owned only | none |
| Group Membership | add/remove any member | add/remove non-owner members | no | no |
| Delete Group | yes | no | no | no |

A Thorium user can be added to a group either as a direct user or as part of a metagroup. This functionality allows you to use
an external group membership system (ie LDAP/IDM) to grant access to Thorium resources.

| type | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| direct user | A single user in Thorium |
| metagroups | A group of users that is defined in LDAP |

By default, metagroup info is updated every 10 minutes or when a Thorium group is updated. This means that when a user
is added or removed from a metagroup it may take up to 10 minutes for that change to be visible in Thorium via the Web
UI.
