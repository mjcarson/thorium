## Deploy Rook

This section will describe how to deploy a Rook Ceph cluster on K8s. This deployment will assume
the K8s cluster member nodes have attached unprovisioned raw storage devices. If you want to use host
storage from an existing mounted filesystem, review the
[rook docs](https://rook.github.io/docs/rook/latest/CRDs/Cluster/host-cluster/) before proceeding. 

> For single server Thorium deployments its best to skip deploying rook and just use a host path
> storageClass provisioner and Minio for better performance.

### 1) Create Rook CRD:

Apply the rook CRD and common resources.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rook/rook/refs/tags/v1.16.4/deploy/examples/crds.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rook/rook/refs/tags/v1.16.4/deploy/examples/common.yaml
```

### 2) Create the Rook operator

You can deploy Rook Ceph with the default operator options. However, you may choose to disable certain drivers
such as CephFS that won't be needed for Thorium. To do that download the operator YAML resource definition and
modify it before applying it.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/rook/rook/refs/tags/v1.16.4/deploy/examples/operator.yaml
```

### 3) Create Ceph/S3 Object Store

Create the Ceph pools and RADOS Object Gateway (RGW) instance(s). You may want to modify the redundancy
factors and number of gateway instances depending on the size of your K8s cluster. Some fields you may
look to modify are:

> The totals of `dataChunks` + `codingChunks` and separately `size` must both be <= the number of k8s
> cluster servers with attached storage that Rook can utilize. If this condition is not met, the Ceph
> cluster Rook deploys will not be in a healthy state after deployment and the Rook operator may fail
> to complete the deployment process.

- `spec.metadataPool.replicated.size` - Set to less than 3 for small k8s clusters
- `spec.dataPool.erasureCoded.dataChunks` - More erasure coding data chunks for better storage efficiency, but lower write performance
- `spec.dataPool.erasureCoded.codingChunks` - More erasure coding chunks for extra data redundancy
- `spec.gateway.instances` - Increase number of RGW pods for larger K8s clusters and better performance

### 4) Create block storage class

Use the following storage class to create a Rook Ceph data pool to store RADOS block devices (RBDs)
that will map to Kubernetes persistent volumes. The following command will create a block device pool
and storageClass (called `rook-ceph-block`). You will use this storage class name for creating PVCs
in the sections that follow. You may want to update the replication factors depending on the size
of your k8s cluster.

- `spec.replicated.size` - Set to less than 3 for small k8s clusters
- `spec.erasureCoded.dataChunks` - More erasure coding data chunks for better storage efficiency, but lower write performance
- `spec.erasureCoded.codingChunks` - More erasure coding chunks for extra data redundancy

### 6) Create a Thorium S3 User

Create a Thorium S3 user and save access/secret key that are generated with the following command. 

```bash
kubectl -n rook-ceph exec -it deploy/rook-ceph-tools -- radosgw-admin user create --uid=thorium-s3-user --display-name="Thorium S3 User"
```

### 7) Deploy Rook Ceph Toolbox pod

```bash
kubectl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rook/rook/refs/heads/master/deploy/examples/toolbox.yaml
```

### 8) Verify Rook pods are all running

```bash
kubectl get pods -n rook-ceph
```

For a 5 node k8s cluster with 2 raw storage devices per node, the output might look like this:

```bash

### 9) Verify Ceph cluster is healthy

If the Rook Ceph cluster is healthy, you should be able to run a status command from the Rook
toolbox. The health section of the cluster status will show `HEALTH_OK`. If you see `HEALTH_WARN`
you will need to look at the reasons at the bottom of the cluster status to troubleshoot the
cause.

```bash
kubectl -n rook-ceph exec -it deploy/rook-ceph-tools -- ceph -s
```

```bash
  cluster:
    id:     20ea7cb0-5cab-4565-bc1c-360b6cd1282b
    health: HEALTH_OK
 
  services:
    mon: 3 daemons, quorum a,b,c (age 1h)
    mgr: b(active, since 1h), standbys: a
