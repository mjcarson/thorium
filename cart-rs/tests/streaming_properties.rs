//! Property tests over adversarial read schedules
//!
//! Every streaming defect this format has had reduces to one of two shapes:
//!
//! * a `poll_read` that returned `Ready` having filled nothing, which `AsyncRead` defines as
//!   end of file, so the caller saw a short file with no error; or
//! * a `poll_read` that threw away work it had already done when the reader underneath it
//!   stalled, which loses the tail of a file just as silently.
//!
//! Neither shape can occur when the reader is a `&[u8]`, because a slice never stalls and never
//! hands back less than it was asked for. That is why the unit tests in `src` never caught any
//! of them. This file drives both sides of a round trip through a reader that stalls and short
//! reads on a generated schedule, through a read buffer that can be a single byte wide.
