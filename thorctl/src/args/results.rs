thorctl results upload --tools my-tool --display-type string ./abcd1234ef5678...

# Set a specific display type for the result (e.g. JSON)
thorctl results upload --tools my-tool --display-type json ./abcd1234ef5678...

# Upload multiple targets in one command
thorctl results upload --tools my-tool --display-type string ./sha1 ./sha2 ./sha3

#   ./results/

thorctl results upload --display-type string ./abcd1234ef5678...

# Specify a custom results file name to upload as the main results (visible in the Web UI)
thorctl results upload --results my_result_file --display-type string ./abcd1234ef5678...

# Restrict results visibility to specific groups
thorctl results upload -G example-group -t my-tool --display-type string ./abcd1234ef5678...

# Any entities the tool discovered are read from a file named 'entities.json' in each
